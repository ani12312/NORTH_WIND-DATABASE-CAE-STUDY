 1. Which shippers do we have?
We have a table called Shippers. Return all the fields from all the
shippers*/

 Certain fields from Categories
In the Categories table, selecting all the fields using this SQL:
Select * from Categories
...will return 4 columns. We only want to see two columns,
CategoryName and Description.*/

 Sales Representatives
We’d like to see just the FirstName, LastName, and HireDate of all the
employees with the Title of Sales Representative. Write a SQL
statement that returns only those employees.*/

Manager.*/

 Orders shipping to France or Belgium
Looking at the Orders table, there’s a field called ShipCountry. Write a

 Orders shipping to any country in Latin America
Now, instead of just wanting to return all the orders from France of
Belgium, we want to show all the orders from any Latin American
country. But we don’t have a list of Latin American countries in a table
in the Northwind database. So, we’re going to just use this list of Latin
American countries that happen to be in the Orders table:
Brazil
Mexico
Argentina
Venezuela
It doesn’t make sense to use multiple Or statements anymore, it would
get too convoluted. Use the In statement.*/

have the oldest employees first.*/

 Showing only the Date with a DateTime field
In the output of the query above, showing the Employees in order of
BirthDate, we see the time of the BirthDate field, which we don’t want.
Show only the date portion of the BirthDate field.*/

LastName joined together in one column, with a space in-between.*/

OrderDetails amount per line item
In the OrderDetails table, we have the fields UnitPrice and Quantity.

ignore the Discount field for now.

 Products with associated supplier names
We’d like to show, for each product, the associated Supplier. Show the
ProductID, ProductName, and the CompanyName of the Supplier. Sort
by ProductID.
This question will introduce what may be a new concept, the Join clause
in SQL. The Join clause is used to join two or more relational database
tables together in a logical way.
Here’s a data model of the relationship between Products and Suppliers.*/

Shipper that was used. Show the OrderID, OrderDate (date only), and
CompanyName of the Shipper, and sort by OrderID.
In order to not show all the orders (there’s more than 800), show only
